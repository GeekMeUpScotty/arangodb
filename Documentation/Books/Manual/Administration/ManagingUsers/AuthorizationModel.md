Authorization Model
===================

Whith the release of ArangoDB 3.2 read only and collection level access was added.

The new authorization model allows us to add other types of rights in the feature. Currently supported are read and write permissions.
Every database object has a least a permissions and collections object. The permissions object holds the rights at dabase level while the collections object hold an object with collection names. Every collection name object holds a permissions object which holds permissions for collection level authorization.

    databases: {
        database-name: {
            permissions: {
                read: true,
                write: false,
            },
            collections: {
                collection-name: {
                    permissions: {
                        read: true,
                        write: false
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

| action   | collection | collection database | _system database |
|----------|------------|---------|------|
| create a document | rw |   |   |
| read a document | r |  |   |
| update a document | rw |   |   |
| drop a document | rw |   |   |
| create a collection |  | rw |   |
| drop a collection |  | rw |   |
| truncate a collection | rw |  |   |
| create an index |   | rw |   |
| drop an index |   | rw |   |
| create a database |   |   | rw |
| drop a database |   |   | rw |
| create a user |   |   | rw |
| update a user |   |   | rw |
| drop a user |   |   | rw |

In this table the collection is a document or ege collection; a collection database is the database in which the collection is stored. The _system database is the system database.

The table shows which rigths are needed for certain actions.

If we want to create a user that can only read all collections in database reports, the permissions json would look this way:

    databases: {
        reports: {
            permissions: {
                read: true,
                write: false,
            },
            collections: {
                *: {
                    permissions: {
                        read: true,
                        write: false
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

### The special collection *
The collection \* is a wildcard and stands for all collections in a database. The permission lookup goes this way:
First look for the exact collection name requested. If the collection could not be found, look for the \* collection.
If the \* collection is found check the permissions on the collection \*. If the collection \* is not found no permissions are granted.

### The special database *
The database \* is a wildcard and stands for all database in a ArangoDB single instance or cluster. The permission lookup goes this way:
First look for the exact databse name requested. If the database could not be found, look for the \* database.
If the \* database is found check the permissions on the database \*. If the database \* is not found no permissions are granted.

    databases: {
        reports: {
            permissions: {
                read: true,
                write: false,
            },
            collections: {
                *: {
                    permissions: {
                        read: true,
                        write: false
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

If we request a document fom the collection daily on the database reports we get access because a read permission 
is defined for the wildcard collection \*.

    databases: {
        reports: {
            permissions: {
                read: true,
                write: false,
            },
            collections: {
                daily: {
                    permissions: {
                        read: true,
                        write: false
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

If we reuqest a document from the collection weekly on the database reports we get no access because the collection weekly
does not exist in the permissions object and also no wildcard collection \*.
